## Dataset

The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.

The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
